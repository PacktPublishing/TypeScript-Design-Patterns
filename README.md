# TypeScript Design Patterns

TypeScript Design Patterns by Packt. It contains all the supporting project
files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## Instructions and Navigation

This is the code repository for
[TypeScript Design Patterns][typescript-design-patterns], published by Packt.
There are no additional code bundle for the following chapters:

- **Chapter 8** - SOLID Principles
- **Chapter 9** - The Road to Enterprise Application

Chapter 8 is mainly about explaining SOLID principles, so the code bundles are
about concepts without actual implementation. Chapter 9 is about a workflow and
related configurations, so it is rather trivial to put them as code bundles
into files.

### Cloning and Browsing

To clone this repository, you will need to install [Git][git] and run
`git clone` command with the URL of this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/TypeScript-Design-Patterns.git
```

In `package.json` file, we have already added the dependency of TypeScript
module, and configured it as the language server of Visual Studio Code with
`.vscode/settings.json`. To browse code in this repository with Visual Studio
Code, you can simply install the dependency using `npm install` and then open
the root directory of this repository as a folder in Visual Studio Code.

### Compiling Code

To see how would the compiled JavaScript files look like, you can use command
`npm run tsc -- -p <chapter-folder>` to compile. For example, if you want to
compile code in `chapter-1`, execute following command after `npm install`:

```sh
npm run tsc -- -p chapter-1
```

If you have compatible TypeScript compiler installed globally, you can just use
the global `tsc` command to compile target code bundle.

Please see Chapter 1 of the book for more information.
