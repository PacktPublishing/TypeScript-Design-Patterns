##Instructions and Navigation
This is the code repository for [TypeScript Design Patterns](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/typescript-design-patterns?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785280832), published by Packt. There are no additional code bundle for the following chapters:

Chapter 8, SOLID Principles

Chapter 9, The Road to Enterprise Application


Chapter 8 is mainly about explaining SOLID principles, so the code snippets is about concept without actual implementation.
Chapter 9 is about a workflow and related configurations, so it is rather trivial to put them as code snippets into files.
